# pandas-challenge
# To complete this assignment, I referenced previous class assignments from week 4 including but not limited to "binning_solution" from class 4.3.
# When creating the per_school_summary I was running into several errors as I tried to use pd.merge to merge 12 separate dataframes. I got back on track thanks to a code solution that Katherine O'Malley from class shared.
# I also used the Xpert Learning Assistant throughout the assignment to help me with cleaning up code and using the proper syntax.
